  <h1>This is Homework Four</h1>
  <p> Animals are like family when treated right<br>
    My dog Ace is like a brother to me<br>
    Dogs are the most common animal to get abused<br>
    and to see innocent dogs get hurt for no reason<br>
    breaks my heart. Which is why I chose Animal Cruelty<br>
    To make people aware, and if you see a stranded dog<br>
    help them. They don't deserve it.<br>
